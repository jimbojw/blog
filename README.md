### about

For a while I wanted to put this together with a couch app, or something even more exotic.

However, the time has come to just get something out the door, and straight up HTML/CSS/JS is the way to do it (for now anyway).

### development

The source tree looks something like this:

* src - source code separated out by type
* build - files used in building the compressed/crushed end result
* dist - output from the build
* test - unit testing n' such

### building

*TBD*

### repository

* [http://github.com/jimbojw/blog/](http://github.com/jimbojw/blog/)

### license

*TBD*
